# ConsoleSpammerJS
```
This is a very basic JS project I did to simply get back into learning JS <3
If you do decide to "spam" the console I suggest the delay to be around 250ms (1/4th) of a second
Any delay less than 250ms could possibly cause some issues :) (don't use this as a crasher)
This can Log both "Ascii" art and standard messages just remember to 'ESCAPE' the strings !!!
